## ‚ú® About the Project

**Screen Savor** is a sleek, user-friendly web application built with **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript** designed to solve one simple problem: **movie discovery**.

Instead of bouncing between streaming services and review sites, you get a beautiful, unified interface to:

* **Browse** the latest trending and top-rated movies.
* **Search** instantly for any film in the database.
* **Preview** high-quality trailers directly within the app.
* **Access** essential details like cast, synopsis, and release dates.

It leverages a powerful **public movie API** (e.g., TMDB) to provide up-to-date and comprehensive film information.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Local Setup

The app is not yet deployed on a public website (coming soon!), but you can easily install and run it locally to see it in action.

### Prerequisites

You need **Git** to clone the repository. A modern web browser is required to view the application.

### Step-by-Step Tutorial

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and fetch the project files:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/gab-dev-7/screen-savor.git](https://github.com/gab-dev-7/screen-savor.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**
    Move into the root folder of the project:

    ```bash
    cd screen-savor
    ```

3.  **Configure API Key (Crucial!)**
    The app requires an API key from **[Specify the API used, e.g., The Movie Database (TMDB)]** to fetch movie data.

    * Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project directory.
    * Add your API key to this file (the format may vary, but typically it looks like this):
        ```
        # Replace YOUR_API_KEY_HERE with your actual key
        TMDB_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" 
        ```
    * *Note: If your project structure requires the key directly in a JavaScript file, follow your internal documentation for that step.*

4.  **Run Locally**
    Since this is a vanilla HTML/CSS/JS project, you usually don't need a Node.js server to run it.

    * Simply open the **`index.html`** file in your web browser.
    * *If you need a local server (e.g., for certain fetch requests), you can use a simple tool like VS Code's "Live Server" extension or run a basic Python HTTP server:*
        ```bash
        # From the project root folder
        python -m http.server 8080
        ```

    The application will now be running, typically accessible at `file:///path/to/index.html` or `http://localhost:8080`.
