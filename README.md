## ✨ About the Project

**Screen Savor** is a sleek, user-friendly web application built with **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript** designed to solve one simple problem: **movie discovery**.

Instead of bouncing between streaming services and review sites, you get a beautiful, unified interface to:

- **Browse** the latest trending and top-rated movies.
- **Search** instantly for any film in the database.
- **Preview** high-quality trailers directly within the app.
- **Access** essential details like cast, synopsis, and release dates.

It leverages a powerful **public movie API** (TMDB) to provide up-to-date and comprehensive film information.
